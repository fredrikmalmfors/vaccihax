# Vaccihax

Written in May, 2021.

Spaghetti web scraper, successfully used (twice) to find available Covid-19 vaccination slots from 10+ web services in Gothenburg. Used together with Pushover to get push-notifications. 

Code uploaded __as is__, reading it will not make you wiser. Very much obsolete by now.
